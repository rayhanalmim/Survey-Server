Lessons Learned in Project Development::

- When I trying to implement like-comment feature, I faced some problems between toggling the like-comment value. I began by thinking about it and addressing it step by step and complite it. In this project there are four types of data collections. I managed all types of data and established connections between them. Before that, I had no idea about Mongoose, which led to some issues during setup and collection creation. However, I overcame each difficulty by identifying and solving the problems with the help of extensive documentation and ChatGPT. Due to time constraints, I couldn't implement the folder structure, but I plan to do it so shortly.
